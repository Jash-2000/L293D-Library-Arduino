##Project Description
---------------------

The project was aimed to create Regulator(Potentiometer) controlled dual DC motor circuitary, and Limit the speed to 3000 rpm.

The potentiometer controlled both Speed and Direction of the motors as follows:

1) Full scale current meant that the bot moves **forward** with 3000rpm.
2) Cut-off current meant that the bot moves **backwards** with 3000rpm.
3) Centre tap current meant that bot **stops** moving.

Additionlly, 2 Emergency buttons were also added to instantaneously bring down the corresponding motor's speed to 0 rpm.
This helped the bot while making turns and/or imitate emergency braking.

**The project was simulated on TinkerCAD**
