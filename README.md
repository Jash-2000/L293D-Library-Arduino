I have added detailed explaination of all the connections in "Connection Schematic" folder in this repository( https://github.com/Jash-2000/L293D-Library-Arduino/tree/master/Connection%20Schematic ).

## About L293D 
---------------------
L293D is dual, H-bridge Motor Controller IC. 

It can be used to control the SPEED and DIRECTION of 2 DC based motors simultaneously.
