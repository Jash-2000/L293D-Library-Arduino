# L293D-Motor-Controller-Library 
## How to Use this Library
--------------------------
Directly clone the entire directory and follow the following steps to use the *Header file* in your Arduino Sketch:


For the ease of understanding, I have added a project that I did with and without using my library. It is present in " Potentiometer Controlled DC-Motor" (https://github.com/Jash-2000/L293D-Library-Arduino/tree/master/Potentiometer%20Controlled%20DC-Motor).

The connection diagram, corresponding to my Library is as follows:

I have added detailed explaination of all the connections in "Connection Schematic" folder in this repository( https://github.com/Jash-2000/L293D-Library-Arduino/tree/master/Connection%20Schematic ).

## About L293D 
---------------------
L293D is dual, H-bridge Motor Controller IC. 

It can be used to control the SPEED and DIRECTION of 2 DC based motors simultaneously.

**Explaination of H-Bridge :**

The detailed explaination is avaliable in H-Bridge Folder in my repository (https://github.com/Jash-2000/L293D-Library-Arduino/tree/master/H-Bridge)

**The pinouts diagram of the IC is as follows:**
